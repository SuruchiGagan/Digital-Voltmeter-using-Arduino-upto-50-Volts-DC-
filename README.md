# Digital-Voltmeter-using-Arduino-upto-50-Volts-DC-
This project implements a voltmeter which measures DC voltage upto 50 volts. A 16*2 LCD display paired with arduino shows the reading of the voltmeter. The connection consists of a voltage divider circuit to measure such large voltages.
The pins of arduino can take up only 5 volts of input at max, so a voltage divider circuit using resistors are created to shield the aduino from high voltages.
